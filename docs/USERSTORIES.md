# Sonic Explorers API User Stories

[Go back to README.md](../README.md)

All user stories are categorized into four themes:
- [User Authentication and Profile Management](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api/issues?q=label%3A%22THEME%3A+User+Authentication+and+Profile+Management%22+is%3Aclosed)
- [Sound Endpoints](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api/issues?q=label%3A%22THEME%3A+Sound+Endpoints%22+is%3Aclosed)
- [User Interactions and Notifications](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api/issues?q=label%3A%22THEME%3A+User+Interactions+and+Notifications%22+is%3Aclosed)
- [Content Moderation](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api/issues?q=label%3A%22THEME%3A+Content+Moderation%22+is%3Aclosed)

Within those themes, user stories are further categorized into epics. A list of all epics can be found [here](https://github.com/nacht-falter/sonic-explorers-api/labels?q=EPIC).

Furthermore, user stories are prioritized using the MoSCoW proritization technique.
